# DALI Component Toolkit

[See the components live here](https://chrism-qmul.github.io/dali-component-toolkit/)

## To use them:

Install LESS and compile the stylesheet
```
npm install -g less
lessc styles.less styles.css
```

Include the stylesheet in your HTML:
```
<link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
```

You do not need to include the assets or images, they are baked into the CSS
file.
